# Edit runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-edit
title: Runtime tool fixture — edit
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.edit
objective: Verify targeted edit behavior is tracked across ACTAgent and Codex while Codex owns edit natively.
successCriteria:
  - ACTAgent may expose ACTAgent edit while Codex app-server mode may omit duplicate ACTAgent dynamic edit.
  - Mock provider edit plans are reported as fixture intent, not as actual runtime tool calls.
  - The row stays report-only until the fixture validates native Codex edit behavior directly.

  summary: Exercise the edit runtime tool family.

      action: split native edit behavior from ACTAgent dynamic tool parity
      reason: Codex app-server intentionally owns edit natively; the fixture must not require ACTAgent dynamic edit exposure.
    knownHarnessGap:
      issue: "#80319"
      reason: QA tool-defaults currently needs native edit behavior coverage instead of ACTAgent dynamic edit exposure.
