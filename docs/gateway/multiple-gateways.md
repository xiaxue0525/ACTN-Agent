title: "Multiple gateways"
---

Most setups should use one Gateway because a single Gateway can handle multiple messaging connections and agents. If you need stronger isolation or redundancy (e.g., a rescue bot), run separate Gateways with isolated profiles/ports.

## Best recommended setup

For most users, the simplest rescue-bot setup is:

- keep the main bot on the default profile
- run the rescue bot on `--profile rescue`
- use a completely separate Telegram bot for the rescue account
- keep the rescue bot on a different base port such as `19789`

This keeps the rescue bot isolated from the main bot so it can debug or apply
config changes if the primary bot is down. Leave at least 20 ports between
base ports so the derived browser/canvas/CDP ports never collide.

## Rescue-Bot Quickstart

Use this as the default path unless you have a strong reason to do something
else:

```bash
# Rescue bot (separate Telegram bot, separate profile, port 19789)
actagent --profile rescue onboard
actagent --profile rescue gateway install --port 19789
```

If your main bot is already running, that is usually all you need.

During `actagent --profile rescue onboard`:

- use the separate Telegram bot token
- keep the `rescue` profile
- use a base port at least 20 higher than the main bot
- accept the default rescue workspace unless you already manage one yourself

If onboarding already installed the rescue service for you, the final
`gateway install` is not needed.

## Why this works

The rescue bot stays independent because it has its own:

- profile/config
- state directory
- workspace
- base port (plus derived ports)
- Telegram bot token

For most setups, use a completely separate Telegram bot for the rescue profile:

- easy to keep operator-only
- separate bot token and identity
- independent from the main bot's channel/app install
- simple DM-based recovery path when the main bot is broken

## What `--profile rescue onboard` Changes

`actagent --profile rescue onboard` uses the normal onboarding flow, but it
writes everything into a separate profile.

In practice, that means the rescue bot gets its own:

- config file
- state directory
- workspace (by default `~/.actagent/workspace-rescue`)
- managed service name

The prompts are otherwise the same as normal onboarding.

## General multi-gateway setup

The rescue-bot layout above is the easiest default, but the same isolation
pattern works for any pair or group of Gateways on one host.

For a more general setup, give each extra Gateway its own named profile and its
own base port:

```bash
# main (default profile)
actagent setup
actagent gateway --port 19199

# extra gateway
actagent --profile ops setup
actagent --profile ops gateway --port 19789
```

If you want both Gateways to use named profiles, that also works:

```bash
actagent --profile main setup
actagent --profile main gateway --port 19199

actagent --profile ops setup
actagent --profile ops gateway --port 19789
```

Services follow the same pattern:

```bash
actagent gateway install
actagent --profile ops gateway install --port 19789
```

Use the rescue-bot quickstart when you want a fallback operator lane. Use the
general profile pattern when you want multiple long-lived Gateways for
different channels, tenants, workspaces, or operational roles.

## Isolation checklist

Keep these unique per Gateway instance:

- `ACTAGENT_CONFIG_PATH` — per-instance config file
- `ACTAGENT_STATE_DIR` — per-instance sessions, creds, caches
- `agents.defaults.workspace` — per-instance workspace root
- `gateway.port` (or `--port`) — unique per instance
- derived browser/canvas/CDP ports

If these are shared, you will hit config races and port conflicts.

## Port mapping (derived)

Base port = `gateway.port` (or `ACTAGENT_GATEWAY_PORT` / `--port`).

- browser control service port = base + 2 (loopback only)
- canvas host is served on the Gateway HTTP server (same port as `gateway.port`)
- Browser profile CDP ports auto-allocate from `browser.controlPort + 9 .. + 108`

If you override any of these in config or env, you must keep them unique per instance.

## Browser/CDP notes (common footgun)

- Do **not** pin `browser.cdpUrl` to the same values on multiple instances.
- Each instance needs its own browser control port and CDP range (derived from its gateway port).
- If you need explicit CDP ports, set `browser.profiles.<name>.cdpPort` per instance.
- Remote Chrome: use `browser.profiles.<name>.cdpUrl` (per profile, per instance).

## Manual env example

```bash
ACTAGENT_CONFIG_PATH=~/.actagent/main.json \
ACTAGENT_STATE_DIR=~/.actagent \
actagent gateway --port 19199

ACTAGENT_CONFIG_PATH=~/.actagent/rescue.json \
ACTAGENT_STATE_DIR=~/.actagent-rescue \
actagent gateway --port 19789
```

## Quick checks

```bash
actagent gateway status --deep
actagent --profile rescue gateway status --deep
actagent --profile rescue gateway probe
actagent status
actagent --profile rescue status
actagent --profile rescue browser status
```

Interpretation:

- `gateway status --deep` helps catch stale launchd/systemd/schtasks services from older installs.
- `gateway probe` warning text such as `multiple reachable gateways detected` is expected only when you intentionally run more than one isolated gateway.
