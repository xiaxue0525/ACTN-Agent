<!-- actagent-plugin-reference:manual-start -->

## Session Listing

`codex_sessions_list` defaults to loaded Codex sessions only. Set `include_stored` to include stored history; the plugin uses Codex app-server's state-DB-only listing path and caps stored results at 200 by default. Pass `max_stored_sessions` to lower or raise that cap, up to 1000.
