title: "Permission modes"
---

Permission modes decide how much authority an agent has before it can run host commands, write files, or ask a backend harness for extra access. Start with `tools.exec.mode: "auto"` when you want ACTAgent to use allowlists first, then Codex native auto-review or a human approval route for misses.

<Note>
  Permission mode is separate from `tools.exec.host=auto`. `tools.exec.host`
  chooses where a command runs. `tools.exec.mode` chooses how host exec is
  approved.
</Note>

## Recommended default

Use `auto` for coding agents that need useful host access without making every miss a human prompt:

```bash
actagent config set tools.exec.mode auto
actagent approvals get
actagent gateway restart
```

Then verify the effective policy:

```bash
actagent exec-policy show
```

In `auto` mode, ACTAgent runs deterministic allowlist matches directly. Approval misses go through ACTAgent's native auto reviewer first, then fall back to the configured human approval route when needed.

## ACTAgent host exec modes

`tools.exec.mode` is the normalized policy surface for host `exec`.

| Mode        | Behavior                                     | Use when                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `deny`      | Block host exec.                             | No host commands are allowed.                         |
| `allowlist` | Run only allowlisted commands.               | You have a known-safe command set.                    |
| `ask`       | Run allowlist matches and ask on misses.     | A human should review new commands.                   |
| `auto`      | Run allowlist matches, then use auto-review. | Coding sessions need practical guarded access.        |
| `full`      | Run host exec without prompts.               | This trusted host/session should skip approval gates. |

For the full host exec policy, local approvals file, allowlist schema, safe bins, and forwarding behavior, see [Exec approvals](/tools/exec-approvals).

## Codex Guardian mapping

For native Codex app-server sessions, `tools.exec.mode: "auto"` maps to Codex Guardian-reviewed approvals when the local Codex requirements allow it. ACTAgent usually sends:

| Codex field         | Typical value     |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| `approvalPolicy`    | `on-request`      |
| `approvalsReviewer` | `auto_review`     |
| `sandbox`           | `workspace-write` |

In `auto` mode, ACTAgent does not preserve legacy unsafe Codex overrides such as `approvalPolicy: "never"` or `sandbox: "danger-full-access"`. Use `tools.exec.mode: "full"` only when you intentionally want the no-approval posture.

For app-server setup, auth order, and native Codex runtime details, see [Codex harness](/plugins/codex-harness).

## ACPX harness permissions

ACPX sessions are non-interactive, so they cannot click a TTY permission prompt. ACPX uses separate harness-level settings under `plugins.entries.acpx.config`:

| Setting                     | Common value    | Meaning                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `permissionMode`            | `approve-reads` | Auto-approve reads only.                    |
| `permissionMode`            | `approve-all`   | Auto-approve writes and shell commands.     |
| `permissionMode`            | `deny-all`      | Deny all permission prompts.                |
| `nonInteractivePermissions` | `fail`          | Abort when a prompt would be required.      |
| `nonInteractivePermissions` | `deny`          | Deny the prompt and continue when possible. |

Set ACPX permissions separately from ACTAgent exec approvals:

```bash
actagent config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.permissionMode approve-all
actagent config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.nonInteractivePermissions fail
actagent gateway restart
```

Use `approve-all` as the ACPX break-glass equivalent of a no-prompt harness session. For setup details and failure modes, see [ACP agents setup](/tools/acp-agents-setup#permission-configuration).

## Choosing a mode

| Goal                                          | Configure                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Block host commands completely                | `tools.exec.mode: "deny"`                                   |
| Let known-safe commands run only              | `tools.exec.mode: "allowlist"`                              |
| Ask a human for every new command shape       | `tools.exec.mode: "ask"`                                    |
| Use Codex/ACTAgent auto-review before humans  | `tools.exec.mode: "auto"`                                   |
| Skip host exec approvals entirely             | `tools.exec.mode: "full"` plus matching host approvals file |
| Make non-interactive ACPX sessions write/exec | `plugins.entries.acpx.config.permissionMode: "approve-all"` |

If a command still prompts or fails after changing mode, inspect both layers:

```bash
actagent approvals get
actagent exec-policy show
```

Host exec uses the stricter result of ACTAgent config and the host-local approvals file. ACPX harness permissions do not loosen host exec approvals, and host exec approvals do not loosen ACPX harness prompts.
