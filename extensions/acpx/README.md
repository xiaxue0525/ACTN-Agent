# @actagent/acpx

Official ACP runtime backend for ACTAgent.

ACPx lets ACTAgent run external coding harnesses through the Agent Client Protocol while ACTAgent still owns sessions, channels, delivery, permissions, and Gateway state.

## Install

```bash
actagent plugins install @actagent/acpx
```

Restart the Gateway after installing or updating the plugin.

## What it provides

- ACP-backed agent runtime sessions.
- Plugin-owned session and transport management.
- MCP bridge helpers for ACTAgent tools and plugin tools.
- Static runtime assets used by the ACP process bridge.
